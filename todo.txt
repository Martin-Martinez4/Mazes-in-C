Comand to format and build:
  cmake --build . --target format

- Make tests
  - rbTree.c
    - searchRBTree

- found out Red Black Tree Based Set is not the best for this use case
  - Instead:
    - Use an array of gridWidth * gridHeight dimensions
    - DSU struct has rank and parent
      - parent is the index of its root
      - merging sets is just setting the value at the index equal to the index of the parent.

        - Find 
          - During find(), make every visited node’s parent point directly to the root
          - Recursive at first while arr[target].parent != target
            - arr[target].parent = find(arr, arr[target].parent);
          - return arr[target].parent;

- attempt to implement krus

- maybe only an array of ints representing the wall states is needed instead of an array of Cells.  

- implement something for diagonal lines.  Option use Bresenham's line algorithm

- Divide surface into grid in code
  - benefical to draw the grid to see it at first


- See if UI is feasible to create using only SDL3
