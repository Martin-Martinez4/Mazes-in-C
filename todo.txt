- [x] Drawing thicker lines cannot be done with SDL_DrawLines; use rectangles instead
  - [x] Will work for horizontal and vertical lines right away
  - implement something for diagonal lines.  Option use Bresenham's line algorithm

- Divide surface into grid in code
  - benefical to draw the grid to see it at first
